# ChatBot

I am well versed in base python, however I am not familiar with many packages. So I decieded to follow a project with sorce code creating a chatbot. https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-chatbot-project/

Intents.json – The data file which has predefined patterns and responses.
train_chatbot.py – In this Python file, we wrote a script to build the model and train our chatbot.
Words.pkl – This is a pickle file in which we store the words Python object that contains a list of our vocabulary.
Classes.pkl – The classes pickle file contains the list of categories.
Chatbot_model.h5 – This is the trained model that contains information about the model and has weights of the neurons.
Chatgui.py – This is the Python script in which we implemented GUI for our chatbot. Users can easily interact with the bot.
